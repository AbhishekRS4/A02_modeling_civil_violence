## TO DO
- [ ] Equation numbers in the report
- [ ] Explain parameters used
- [ ] Use uniform figures and tables
- [ ] Add source to 60% in introduction
- [ ] "a" and "the" missing so check in Grammerly before submitting and for figure start with F
- [ ] Highlight factors considered in movement
- [ ] Rebel movement change sign 
- [ ] Add hot spot and grouping of people are done by system(not hard-coded)
- [ ] Explain parameters value are were selected based on various scenario study locally and those effects are studied globally through dynamic simulation system
- [ ] Future mathematics work need more explaination and text formatting
- [ ] In summary and discussion state that epstein model findings were also present in our model
